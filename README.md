# SDM-Intersection
Assignment for the course 'Software Development' where we need to develop two modules consisting of a controller and a simulator which will communicate between eachother to resemble an intersection in the end. The main thing to learn from this assignment is communication with other groups in order to mix between controllers or simulators from other groups while the application will still run.
